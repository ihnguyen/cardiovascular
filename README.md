Hello, my name is Thuy-Nhi Nguyen and I am an aspiring data analyst.
I have a Bachelors in Science in Biochemistry and a year of continuing education in Healthcare Analytics.

I present you two SQL projects on Healthcare that display my skillset in SQL, statistics, and my domain knowledge in healthcare.
1. Does high levels of cholesterol increase your odds of having hypertension?
2. Predicting length of stay in beneficiaries using county-level profiling and multiple linear regression on Medicare claims data

You can find these topics in the QuantitativeAnalysis and AppliedStatistics files above. The SQL queries are found at the end of each document.
